1.  The project assumes that db database with db_user, db_pass credentials is available.
    To create it the following commands should be used:
    a) 1st command line window: 
        - cd <mysql_directory>\bin\
        - mysqld.exe
    b) 2nd command line window:
        - cd <mysql_directory>\bin\
        - mysql.exe -u root
    c) withing mysql client window:
        - create database db;
        - create user 'db_user'@'localhost' identified by 'db_pass';
        - grant all on db.* to 'db_user'@'localhost';
        - exit

2.  In persistence.xml file add your entity classes using Add Class... button
    in Design view, or in Source view add for each entity
    <class>fully.qualified.name.of.the.Class</class>

3.  Create package structure including:
    a) pl.polsl.lastname.firstname
        - controller class containing only main method and nothing else
    b) pl.polsl.lastname.firstname.model
        - entity classes
        - database manager class(es) performing CRUD operations
    c) pl.polsl.lastname.firstname.view
        - view class reading data from user and/or printing data on screen

Keep the menu to the minimum, JPA part is the most important part of the project.
